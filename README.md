# Inputs

These should probably be shown in a notebook?

*  `squs.csv` (generated by fetcher)
*  `products.csv` (generated by SQL run against our postgres database)
*  `adqs_2017_06_01.csv` (from an FOI request)
*  `provided_adqs.csv`: (generated by us from ADQs provided in NHS Digital dump)

To generate these:

    export DB_PASS=xxxxx
    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/json
    python ./generate_data.py


# Best practice

* Supplied, generated data files should always be time-stamped
